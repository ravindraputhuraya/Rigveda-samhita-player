The Rig Samhita Player is a purpose-built study environment designed to support students engaged in the sincere, structured, and guided study of the Rig Veda under the direction of a Guru.

This tool is not a replacement for a Guru; it is a digital extension of the traditional Guru-Śiṣya Paramparā, created to assist in structured revision and mindful repetition.
